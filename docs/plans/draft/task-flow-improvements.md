# Task Flow Improvements

## Summary

Improve the task creation and tracking experience with human-readable naming, web-based task entry, and better visibility into lobster jobs. Currently task IDs are date-slugs (`2026-02-15-unity-ui`), k8s job names are auto-generated, and the only way to create tasks is via Discord or manually editing vault files.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Naming scheme for tasks: keep date prefix for sorting, add a human-friendly name? e.g. `2026-02-15-unity-ui` displays as "Unity UI Overhaul" with the ID as metadata?
- [ ] Naming scheme for k8s jobs: include task name fragment? e.g. `lobster-swe-unity-ui-abc12` instead of `lobster-swe-1739...`? k8s name limit is 63 chars
- [ ] Web task entry: should this live on the lobboss dashboard, lobwife dashboard, or a new standalone UI?
- [ ] Web task entry: should it just create the vault file, or also trigger lobboss to pick it up? (Currently lobboss polls the vault on a schedule)
- [ ] Should task names be user-provided at creation time, or auto-generated from the task description (e.g. LLM-summarized slug)?
- [ ] Do we want task short-codes for quick reference in Discord? e.g. `#T42` alongside the full ID?

## Current State

### Task IDs
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug` (e.g. `2026-02-15-fix-login-bug`)
- Generated by lobboss when creating task files in the vault
- Used as the canonical identifier everywhere: vault filename, k8s job labels, Discord threads, PRs

### K8s Job Names
- Format: `lobster-{type}-{timestamp}-{random}` (e.g. `lobster-swe-1739654321-x4k2p`)
- Generated by lobboss `spawn_lobster()` in `mcp_tools.py`
- Not human-friendly — hard to correlate with tasks when running `kubectl get jobs`

### Task Entry
- Primary: Discord message in #task-queue, lobboss creates the task
- Secondary: Manual vault file creation (used for system tasks, testing)
- No web UI for task entry

## Phases

### Phase 1: Human-readable job naming

- **Status**: pending
- Update `spawn_lobster()` in `mcp_tools.py` to include task slug in k8s job name
- Format: `lobster-{type}-{task-slug}-{short-hash}` (e.g. `lobster-swe-unity-ui-a3f2`)
- Truncate slug to fit within 63-char k8s name limit
- Update `lobster_status` tool to display the friendly name
- Update task-manager and status-reporter to use the new naming in logs/reports

### Phase 2: Task display names

- **Status**: pending
- Add optional `name` field to task frontmatter (human-readable, doesn't affect the ID)
- lobboss generates a short display name from the task description if not provided
- Display name shown in Discord threads, web dashboards, status reports
- ID remains the canonical key for file paths and k8s labels

### Phase 3: Web-based task entry

- **Status**: pending
- Add a task creation form to the lobboss web dashboard (port 8080)
- Fields: description, type (swe/research/qa), priority, target repos, optional name
- Submit creates the vault task file and optionally notifies Discord
- Read-only task list view with status, assigned lobster, links to PRs
- Authentication: initially cluster-internal only (port-forward access), WAN access deferred to web UI plan

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|

## Scratch

- Could add a task search/filter to the web UI (by status, type, date range)
- Discord thread names could include the task display name instead of just the ID
- Task short-codes (#T1, #T2...) would need a counter — vault-level or lobboss-level? Sequential numbering across task creation sessions is tricky with distributed writers
- Consider a task URL scheme: `lobmob://task/2026-02-15-unity-ui` that deep-links to the web dashboard
- The lobboss web dashboard currently shows fleet status — task entry would be a natural second tab
