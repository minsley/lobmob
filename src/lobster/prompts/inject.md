# Operator Guidance: {task_id}

You were interrupted mid-task on **{task_id}**. Your last tool call was denied because
the operator has new guidance for you.

## Operator messages

## What to do

Review what you have already done in this session. Then incorporate the operator's
guidance above and continue your work. Do not restart from scratch — build on what
you've already completed.

If the operator's guidance changes the direction of the task, proceed accordingly.
If it adds to the task, complete the original work plus the new direction.
